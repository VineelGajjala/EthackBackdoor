Current Issues/Goals:
    - how to get server.py onto machine?
        - Curl?
    - cronjob for creation and running on start



Things to do:
    1. provide remote root shell access to the system it's running on. From the controlling host, we should be able to send commands to the backdoored week4 machine.
        - Works, can send command and get expected output

    2. TODO: persist even if the machine reboots. 
        - cronjob on startup?

    3. have some sort of configuration for where it gets commands from. This can be a file, argument, source code modification, etc. This way we can test it out, even if our controller host has a different address than yours.
        - Works, we do it via argument, not sure about the second line

    4. authenticate its communication and/or commands. We don't want another attacker taking over our system. 
        -one way hash: password is hill

    5. attempt to hide itself from at least one detection method.
        - delete and reinstall itself upon creation?

        - randomize port? but how does the user know the port?
        -We select one of ten ports randomly to choose which to use, and the client tries the ports sequentially until we find the one that is correct.
